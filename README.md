# Project Analyzer

A VS Code extension that analyzes project structure and records terminal activities. This tool is designed to help developers efficiently share project overviews when consulting with AI about coding issues.

## Features

### 1. Project Structure Analysis (`projectAnalyzer.generateStructure`)

Analyzes the entire project structure and generates detailed documentation.

- Generates `project-structure.md` in the project's root directory
- Excludes files listed in .gitignore
- Documentation structure includes:
  - Project information (name, version, description)
  - Configuration files content (e.g., package.json)
  - Detailed file structure with:
    - Directory hierarchy using icons (üìÅ for directories, üìÑ for files)
    - For JavaScript (.js), TypeScript (.ts), and Python (.py) files:
      - Import statements
      - Exports
      - Functions
      - Components
      - Methods
      - Classes

Example output structure:

```markdown
# Workspace Structure

Files listed in .gitignore will be excluded.

## Project Info

- Name: [project name]
- Version: [version]
- Description: [description]

## Configuration Files

[Content of important configuration files]

## File Structure

- üìÑ file.ts
  - Imports: [list of imports]
  - Exports: [list of exports]

```

### 2. Terminal Activity Logging

A terminal operation logging feature that can be controlled via the "Terminal Log" button in the status bar.
